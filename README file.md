This project investigates youth smoking and drug use through a multi-step analysis encompassing exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and predictive modeling.
The EDA phase focuses on understanding feature distributions and identifying correlations, laying the foundation for enhanced data preparation. 
Predictive modeling techniques, including linear regression and random forest regressor, are then employed to predict smoking prevalence. 
Model performance is evaluated using standard metrics to ensure robust and actionable insights. 

This analysis aims to provide data-driven recommendations for addressing youth smoking and substance use behaviors.
